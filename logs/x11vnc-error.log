Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.

19/03/2025 18:22:17 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
19/03/2025 18:22:17   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
19/03/2025 18:22:17   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
19/03/2025 18:22:17    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
19/03/2025 18:22:17    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
19/03/2025 18:22:17      moved window is released in the new position.
19/03/2025 18:22:17   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
19/03/2025 18:22:17   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to

19/03/2025 18:22:17   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
19/03/2025 18:22:17   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting

Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
